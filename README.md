## Process 

1. Automated uploading of dataset to posgresql through a python script

```python
# Library
import psycopg2
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text

# Define the database connection parameters
db_params = {
    'host': 'xxxxxxxxx',
    'database': 'xxxxxxxxx',
    'user': 'xxxxxxxxx',
    'password': 'xxxxxxxxxx'
}

# Connect to the 'xxxxxxxx' database
db_params['database'] = 'xxxxxxxx'
engine = create_engine(f'postgresql://{db_params["user"]}:{db_params["password"]}@{db_params["host"]}/{db_params["database"]}')

# Define the file paths for your CSV files
csv_files = {
    'tmdb_movie_credits': '/home/tmdb_movie_credits.csv',
    'tmdb_movie_dataset': '/home/tmdb_movie_dataset.csv',
    'tmdb_movie_ratings': '/home/tmdb_movie_ratings.csv',
}

# Load and display the contents of each CSV file to check
for table_name, file_path in csv_files.items():
    print(f"Contents of '{table_name}' CSV file:")
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    print(df.head(2))  # Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
    print("\n")

# Loop through the CSV files and import them into PostgreSQL
for table_name, file_path in csv_files.items():
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    df.to_sql(table_name, engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)
```

2. Created a summarized table for further analysis

```sql
SELECT 
    tmdbid,
    title,
    AVG(rating) AS avg_rating,
    popularity,
    original_language,
    revenue,
    budget,
    revenue - budget AS profit,
    release_date,
    runtime
FROM tmdb_movie_dataset AS dataset 
FULL OUTER JOIN tmdb_movie_ratings AS rate
    ON dataset.ratingid = rate.ratingid
GROUP BY
    tmdbid,
    title,
    popularity,
    original_language,
    revenue,
    budget,
    release_date,
    runtime
ORDER BY popularity DESC, 1
```

## Analysis

4. Analysis of various movie preferences by each users

To recommend movie titles per user, I've analyzed the genre preferences of each user based on the movies they've rated. I've utilized Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to perform multiple JOIN operations. The CTE is primarily responsible for extracting values from a column named 'genres', which is of JSON type.

```sql
WITH genres_cte AS (
    SELECT
        tmdbid,
        title,
        jsonb_array_elements(genres::jsonb)->>'name' AS genre
    FROM tmdb_movie_dataset
)
SELECT
    rate.userid,
    genres_cte.genre,
    AVG(rate.rating) AS avg_rate,
    AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity
FROM tmdb_movie_dataset AS data
JOIN tmdb_movie_ratings AS rate
    ON rate.ratingid = data.ratingid
JOIN genres_cte
    ON data.tmdbid = genres_cte.tmdbid
GROUP BY rate.userid, genres_cte.genre 
    HAVING rate.userid = 2
ORDER BY 1 ASC, 3 DESC
```

With the available data on each user's genre preferences, I've conducted a query to identify the top-rated movie titles suitable for recommendation to a particular user. To ensure high-quality recommendations, I've filtered the movie titles to include only those with an average rating of at least 4.0.

```sql
WITH movie_recommendation AS (
    WITH user_preference_cte AS (
        WITH genres_cte AS (
            SELECT
                tmdbid,

                jsonb_array_elements(genres::jsonb)->>'name' AS genre
            FROM tmdb_movie_dataset
        )
        SELECT
            rate.userid,
            genres_cte.genre,

        GROUP BY rate.userid, genres_cte.genre 
    )
    SELECT title, avg_rating, titles_per_genre.genre
    FROM (

        FROM tmdb_movie_dataset AS data
        JOIN tmdb_movie_ratings AS rate
            ON data.ratingid = rate.ratingid
        GROUP BY tmdbid, title, genre
    ) AS titles_per_genre
    JOIN user_preference_cte
        ON titles_per_genre.genre = user_preference_cte.genre
    WHERE userid = 2 AND avg_rate >= 4 AND avg_rating >= 4
    ORDER BY 2 DESC
    LIMIT 20

5. Determining the ideal month for releasing a movie.

Initially, it's worthwhile to assess the total number of movie titles per month of release. Utilizing SQL's PARTITION BY feature, I segmented the count of movie titles by month.

```sql
SELECT
    DISTINCT(release_month),
    COUNT(release_month) OVER (PARTITION BY release_month) AS movie_count
FROM (
    SELECT
        tmdbid,
        title,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM release_date::DATE) AS release_month
    FROM tmdb_movie_dataset
    ) AS movie_per_month
ORDER BY movie_count DESC
```

Top months with most movie released
```
 release_month | movie_count 
---------------+-------------
             9 |         568
            10 |         449
            12 |         446
             8 |         403
             6 |         376
             3 |         356
             1 |         351
             5 |         346
             7 |         344
             4 |         330
            11 |         318
             2 |         315
(12 rows)
```

To identify the month with the highest grossing revenue, I partitioned the average revenue per month.

```sql
SELECT
    DISTINCT(release_month),
    AVG(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY release_month) AS avg_revenue
FROM (
    SELECT
        tmdbid,
        title,
        revenue,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM release_date::DATE) AS release_month
    FROM tmdb_movie_dataset
    WHERE revenue > 0
    ) AS movie_per_month
ORDER BY avg_revenue DESC
```

Top grossing month
```
 release_month |      avg_revenue      
---------------+-----------------------
             6 |    198122700.05016722
             5 |    190339023.16470588
            11 |    159759462.68060837
            12 |    148051475.78134111
             7 |    147955088.08394161
             4 |    111420815.03879310

             9 | 58720822.122500000000

## Insights

1. Explore whether specific genres lead to higher user engagement.

Adventure, Animation, and Science Fiction stand out as the most popular movie genres, reflecting their ability to evoke excitement, imagination, and futuristic themes. Despite their lower average popularity, War films attract a dedicated audience who values their depth and historical significance, leading to higher ratings. However, Romance and Comedy genres, despite their widespread appeal, lag behind in both popularity and rating, indicating a possible need for innovation. Genres like Music, TV Movie, and Documentary show niche interests or limited mainstream appeal, with lower popularity scores.

2. Develop insights into the optimal budget range for different genres.
 
 For highly visual genres like Animation, Adventure, and Family, investing in moderately high budgets seems justified to match their high revenue potential. Thriller, Mystery, and War genres demonstrate potential for high profitability with comparatively modest budgets, focusing more on storytelling than elaborate visuals. Romance and Comedy genres, while popular, can still yield profits with moderate to low budgets. Horror films show high profitability with minimal investments, leveraging atmosphere and suspense. Music and Documentary genres, with lower revenues, can still be profitable with targeted marketing despite their modest budgets. In summary, the optimal budget range varies across genres, from high investments in visual spectacles to modest budgets emphasizing storytelling.

3. Develop a model that suggests movies to users based on their historical ratings and preferences for specific genres.

In developing a model for suggesting movies to users based on their historical ratings and genre preferences, I've undertaken a systematic approach. First, I analyzed each user's genre preferences by examining their rated movies, employing Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to facilitate multiple JOIN operations, particularly extracting values from a JSON-type column labeled 'genres'. Next, leveraging this data, I crafted a query to pinpoint top-rated movie titles tailored to each user. To maintain high-quality recommendations, I implemented a filtering mechanism to include only movies with an average rating of at least 4.0, ensuring that suggested titles meet a superior standard of quality aligned with user preferences. This method combines both analytical insights into user behavior and rigorous quality control to provide personalized and satisfying movie recommendations.

4. Analyze the relationship between movie release dates and revenue.

The analysis reveals interesting trends regarding the relationship between movie release dates and revenue. Despite September having the highest number of movie releases, it's not among the top months for grossing revenue. Instead, June and May emerge as the top-grossing months, suggesting that summer releases tend to perform exceptionally well financially. This trend aligns with the traditional blockbuster season, where studios often release high-budget and highly anticipated films to capitalize on summer vacations and increased leisure time. Additionally, November and December also stand out as lucrative months, indicating the impact of holiday releases and end-of-year moviegoing trends.

## Recommendation

Based on analysis, key recommendations for the film industry include prioritizing popular genres like Adventure, Animation, and Science Fiction for higher user engagement. Strategic budget allocation is crucial, with visually immersive genres justifying higher investments while others focus on storytelling with modest budgets. Developing a recommendation model based on user preferences ensures high-quality suggestions. Timing movie releases during blockbuster seasons like June and May, as well as holiday periods in November and December, can maximize revenue.
